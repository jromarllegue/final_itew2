Run [index.html](https://replit.com/@JRomarLlegue/DCPMSwithAS#index.html) to navigate through created html outputs. 

Things to note while editing the code\:
<br>• class names should be in "lower-lower" case format
<br>• id names should be in "lowerUpper" case format
<br>• do not add \<br> in html as much as possible
<br>• designs for user interface should be combined in this file --> [user.css](https://replit.com/@JRomarLlegue/DCPMSwithAS#user.css)
<br>• functions for user interface should be combined in this file --> [user.js](https://replit.com/@JRomarLlegue/DCPMSwithAS#user.js)
<br>• [account.js](https://replit.com/@JRomarLlegue/DCPMSwithAS#account.js) is for loggin in and signing up
<br>• you can do anything for admin interface, i kinda don't want to do it anyway

Important things to be used in code based from final lectures:
<br>\- localStorage
<br>\- JQuery
<br>\- try / catch

Nagawa tayo ng system for clinic kaya kaylangan natin ng doctor figure dito.<br>
2 na doctor minimum (para sa schedule & para sa complexity narin)
<br><br>
Suggestions ko sa mga pedeng doctor:
<br>Doctor 1&2: kahit sino pede DI KASAMA AKO
<br>Doctor 3: optional, can be none

<br>(ang mapipili magsusuot ng pan-doctor o pormal na damit para sa fake bio, walang tatanggi)

<br>
When downloading the files:
<br>Better compile them all in one folder, preferably naming the folder "FinalProject". New files to be created must also be added there, to know which is for the project and which is not. Don't include the readme file obviously.
